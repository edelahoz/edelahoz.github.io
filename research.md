I work on CMB data analysis, with the ultimate goal of understanding the underlying mechanisms of the Universe we live in. Currently, my focus, like most of the CMB community, is on establishing whether the Universe experienced an inflationary phase at its beginning. A smoking gun of this phenomenon would be the detection of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). These predicted PGWs leave an imprint on the polarization pattern,  B-modes, of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Their detection is extremely challenging since they are hidden by the emission from other sources, for example:
- Astrophysical sources that emit in the microwave range. 
- E- to B-modes conversion due to gravitational lensing. 
- Systematic errors, and instrumental noise. 


The majority of the work that I have conducted so far focuses on the characterization and removal of astrophysical foreground contamination as well as systematic effects to extract the CMB signal. Below, I give examples of those works:


<h3> <b> <span style="color:#00b1c9"> Forecasts for future CMB ground experiments </span>  </b> </h3>

Initiatives for new CMB experiments require extensive exploratory studies of all the instrumental characteristics parameter space to find the optimal configuration that meets their scientific objectives. Furthermore, funding agencies want proposals that are convincing and well-justified. I applied the B-SeCRET methodology that I developed to test several configurations of an envisioned ground-based CMB experiment, operating at low frequencies (10-120 GHz), within the context of the ELFS initiative. We found several arrangements that satisfied the objective of detecting PGWs with a precision of \\(\sigma_r \lesssim 10^{-3}\\). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proposed experiment helps constrain the foreground parameters in planned missions such as LiteBIRD. As a result, this improves the recovery of the CMB signal and the detection of PGWs with this mission. 


<h3> <b> <span style="color:#00b1c9"> Characterization of low-frequency astrophysical foregrounds </span>  </b> </h3>


The importance of a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and modeling of astrophysical foregrounds for CMB analyses is twofold: 

1. to reduce residuals due to astrophysical foregrounds in the extracted CMB signal, and
2. to generate more realistic sky simulations for forecasting studies of future CMB experiments.

In this framework, I studied the diffuse polarized foregrounds, focusing on the polarized synchrotron emission, using the new data from the QUIJOTE-MFI instrument and ancillary data. The novelty of this study arises from the inclusion of the final data from the QUIJOTE-MFI instrument, which has measured the sky in the unique 10-20 GHz frequency range. With this data, we obtained the first detailed map of the polarized synchrotron's spectral index \\(\beta_s\\) in the Northern Hemisphere and proved that its spatial variations are statistically significant.

<h3> <b> <span style="color:#00b1c9"> Removal of systematic errors derived from miscalibrated polarization rotation angles </span>  </b> </h3>

Future polarization CMB experiments will require unprecedented sensitivities to detect the PGWs, posing new challenges in the systematic instrumental effects control. Miscalibrated polarisation angles are one of the most significant known sources of systematic error. A rotation of the polarization angle results in the mixing of the measured E- and B-modes, obscuring the primordial B-mode signal. In collaboration with Patricia Diego-Palazuelos, we implemented a methodology to calculate the polarization angles based on nulling the cross-angular power spectrum between E- and B- modes. This methodology was applied in a LiteBIRD collaboration paper showcasing LiteBIRD's in-flight calibration pipeline. It was shown that, after correcting the miscalibration angles with the estimated angles, we obtain an unbiased estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, \\(r\\).

Both methodologies have been extended to obtain simultaneously miscalibrated polarization angles and a "birefringence" angle \\(\beta\\). \\(\beta\\) represents the rotation experienced by CMB photons from recombination until today. A non-zero birefringence angle would constitute strong evidence of a parity-violating process in our Universe, predicted by several extensions of the standard model of cosmology. 

<h3> <b> <span style="color:#00b1c9"> Other studies </span>  </b> </h3>

Apart from the studies listed above, I have worked in the following CMB-related studies:
- I studied whether LiteBIRD would be able to detect the secondary anisotropies induced by the Rayleigh Scattering of CMB photons with neutral light atoms at recombination.
- I analyzed the polarisation counterpart of large-scale intensity peaks, such as the Cold Spot, to determine LiteBIRD's constraining power concerning the fluke hypothesis.
